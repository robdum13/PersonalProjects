Problem 3: Content Creator
Description
The application is designed for restoring content (structure folders, file contents etc.), starting from a predefined structure. The structure is described in the Structure.txt file (which can also be used as a sample for testing the application, as you advance on the requirements detailed below).
The ContentDescriptor.txt structure is as follows:
·	Each line represents a folder or file that needs to be created on the HDD - the information related to an item is separated by |
·	A line is described as follows: ParentFolderID|ItemID|ItemType|ItemName|Content_of_file_if_ItemType_is_F
·	ParentFolderID represents an ItemID of type Directory. The items that you are about to create for a specific line, have to be children of this ParentFolder. The ParentFolderID always represent ItemIDs for Directory items
1.	If ParentFolderID is 0, this means that it has no other parent, it will be created in the root folder
·	ItemID - a unique ID in the ContentDescriptor.txt file that can be used internally (in the program), to identify a Directory or File
·	ItemType - it can be either D (Directory) or F (File)
·	ItemName - either a folder name (if ItemType is D) or a file name (if ItemType is F)
·	Content_of_file_if_ItemType_is_F - if the ItemType is F, the content will be written in the file that you've just created
·	Examples:
·	0|1|D|Folder_1
·	Parameters:
2.	ParentFolderID = 0
3.	ItemID = 1
4.	ItemType = Directory
5.	ItemName = Folder_1
·	For this line, you would create a directory called "Folder_1" in the root directory
·	1|2|D|SubFolder1_1
·	Parameters:
6.	ParentFolderID = 1
7.	ItemID = 2
8.	ItemType = Directory
9.	ItemName = SubFolder_1_1
·	For this line, you would create a directory called "SubFolder_1_1" in the "Folder_1" directory that you've created above
·	1|3|F|File1.txt|Content1
·	Parameters:
10.	ParentFolderID = 1
11.	ItemID = 3
12.	ItemType = File
13.	ItemName = File_1
14.	Content_of_file_if_ItemType_is_F = Content1
·	For this line, you would create a file called File_1" in the "Folder_1" directory that you've created above, and you would write "Content1" in the file

Requirements

The application will be written in C/C++ native, and you are allowed to use MSDN or Google.

1. Create a function that receives a file path (the file path for ContentDescriptor.txt) and that reads the entire file in memory (in a struct/class/etc. - you decide the best storage solution). Also write a function that receives the storage structure and displays its contents recursively, as follows:
(D) Folder_1
(F) Folder_1 -> File_1.txt
(F) Folder_1 -> File_2.xt
(D) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_1
(F) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_1 -> File_1_1.txt
(F) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_1 -> File_1_2.txt
(D) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_1 -> SubFolder_1_2
(F) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_1 -> SubFolder_1_2 -> File_1_2_1.txt
(F) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_2 -> File_2_1.txt
(F) Folder_1 -> SubFolder_2 -> File_2_2.txt
etc.

2. Create a function for writing the contents of a file on disk (it should receive the path to the file, and the string content that needs to be written in the file)

3. Create a function that receives as parameter the storage structure, and that creates the required directories, writes the required files and their contents on disk

Tips

You could search MSDN for methods such as: CreateFile, CreateDirectory, WriteFile etc. or you could use your own preferred functions from C++.
